This website was built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I'm working with Bootstrap. I started by designing the navbar and hero section.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp?) - This helped me for convert hsl color to hex color. I really liked this tool and will use it going forward.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) - This is an amazing docs which helped me finally understand bootstrap. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept with Bootstrap, the worldâ€™s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites.
